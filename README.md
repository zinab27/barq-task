# DevOps Internship Task - Starter v2

**Due date:** ____________________

**Time window:** 4 calendar days from the invitation email date/time.

Read [the task](assessment/TASK.md), then [the API contract](assessment/APPLICATION.md).
Everyone receives this same release. The environment is intentionally broken.
Hidden issue types and count are not disclosed. Investigate this project; do not replace it.

## Included

- Flask API, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker and NGINX starter files.
- Three historical logs, a question template and documentation templates.
- App-only tests and a recorded challenge script.
- Unimplemented validation, failure-test and backup/restore placeholders.

Use synthetic lab accounts/data only. Supplied values are for this disposable exercise,
never for real services. Keep the lab on your local machine; do not expose it publicly.

## Before you start

- Linux or WSL2, Python 3.12, Git and Docker with Compose.
- Docker Desktop must use Linux containers. Run shell scripts in Linux/WSL.
- Suggested capacity: 2 CPU cores, 4 GB free RAM and 3 GB free disk, plus Docker overhead.
- Internet for first downloads and GitHub. No cloud account or paid registry required.
- Use a machine where container names app-01, app-02, nginx, postgres and redis are unused.
  Do not delete someone else's containers to free those names.
- Intended public port: 8080 before the video, 8090 after the live change.
  If either is occupied, ask the organizer for a documented workstation exception.

## Start

Clone the supplied Git bundle/repository. Keep both release commits and the v2 baseline tag.
Set your own Git name/email before making changes.

From the repository root:

```bash
git status
git log -2 --oneline
cp .env.example .env
docker version
docker compose version
docker compose -p barq-assessment up --build -d
docker compose -p barq-assessment ps -a
docker compose -p barq-assessment logs --no-color
```

The initial environment is not expected to pass. Record what actually happens.
The intended URL is http://127.0.0.1:8080; do not assume the starter configuration is correct.

App-only checks use fake dependencies, not real SQL/Redis or Docker networking:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Your work

- Complete [assessment/TASK.md](assessment/TASK.md).
- Implement validate.py, failure_test.py, backup.sh and restore.sh, or documented equivalents.
  Placeholders deliberately exit 2; they are unfinished deliverables, not validation evidence.
- Create .github/workflows/ci.yml yourself.
- Complete the root report templates and docs/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md.
- Add architecture.png or architecture.pdf.
- Replace this README with copyable setup/build/run/test/failure/backup/restore/cleanup commands.
- Commit as you work. Do not commit real secrets, backups, virtual environments or challenge state.

## Recorded challenge

Use the supplied video_challenge.sh unchanged. Read its code if needed; do not run it early.
After repairing the environment, run it once, for the first time in the video working copy,
during the continuous 12-18 minute recording. The script requires healthy services, both
initial instances and the target network layout. Preflight failures make no runtime changes.

```bash
./video_challenge.sh
```

If you deliberately changed the project name, pass --project YOUR_PROJECT.
An organizer-approved alternate local URL can be passed with --url http://127.0.0.1:PORT.
The script touches only matching Compose-owned lab containers/networks.
Keep the receipt in .assessment/challenge.json for the evidence index. Do not delete the
one-run marker to retry. A local marker is not tamper-proof; ownership is judged from evidence.
Do not use docker compose down to reset the runtime challenge.

## Stop safely

Outside the recorded challenge, docker compose -p barq-assessment down stops this lab.
Do not use --volumes during persistence tests. Avoid global Docker prune/cleanup commands.
Back up anything you need before removing containers; investigate whether data actually persists.
